# Arduino_Based_LED_Propellor_Clock
The LED Propeller Clock is a time displaying device cum a fancy decorative item to be used to decorate modern houses. 
Time is an important essence in life, since without time one cannot schedule their day to day routine and chores in life. 
In today’s world everyone has various means to check time i.e smart phones, wrist watches and almost every digital device like TV and Laptops these days show time, but this fact doesn’t stop people from getting wall clock since every house has one.
Wall clocks are basically used to decorate houses and also to show time without having to look at your wristwatch or smartphone, basically every house needs one.
Led Propeller Clocks are the new version of wall clocks possibly replacing the old retro versions in the possible future.


A LED display fan clock made using a thin strap of PCB board connected with various components like LED lights, Resistors, capacitor, Hall Sensor etc. to be rotated on a DC motor to display Time using LED lights blinking in sync to the rotation speed of the motor using the uploaded code in Arduino Nano. 

**LED Propellor Clock Fan**
Led Propellor Clock Fan is a clock with both digital display as well as analog display. It is made up on a PCB with the help of Arduino as a microcontroller to receive and send information as per programmed code, couple of LED lights to display the time when the FAN(strap of PCB circuit) rotates, couple of resistors, a capacitor and mainly a Hall Sensor which reacts to the magnet to give output “HIGH” or “LOW” which results in running of the code is sussession.
•	The main components of the LPC fan are as follows:-

1.	Arduino NANO (AT mega 328 processor)
2.	Hall sensor 3144
3.	IR Led Sensor(38Khz)
4.	100uf capacitor
5.	Resistors 100, 270, 2.2K ohms
6.	LED lights (Red, Green, Blue)
7.	DC motor
8.	3.7v Battery
9.	Connecting wires
